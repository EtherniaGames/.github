## Hi there 👋 We're Ethernia Games, Welcome!

🙋‍♀️ We're Ethernia Games, a small, independent and creative game dev team with big ideas.

🐱‍💻 Everyone can contribute in our public repositories, most of them we're using in our internal projects.

👩‍💻 You can find some useful informations on each repository. Soon we'll open a public Discord server to interact with everyone who is interested in our games.

🍿 Our team is made of friends, yes, we're all friends who have this dream of create an awesome game. Who doesn't?

Well, we'll update this README with more information soon, thanks 😁👍
